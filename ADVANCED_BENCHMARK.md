## System Architecture

The Advanced Benchmark System consists of several key components:

- **Test Case Generator**: Creates domain-specific test cases based on a given topic
- **Model Selector**: Intelligently selects appropriate models for benchmarking
- **Benchmark Runner**: Executes test cases against selected models
- **Result Analyzer**: Evaluates and compares model performances
- **Domain Expertise Analyzer**: Assesses model performance across different knowledge domains
- **Cost Efficiency Analyzer**: Evaluates the cost-effectiveness of different models

The system is designed to be modular, allowing for easy extension and customization.

## Test Case Generation

### Overview

The test case generation system creates diverse, domain-specific test cases based on a given topic. It uses LLMs to generate high-quality test cases that cover different aspects and difficulty levels.

### Intelligent Model Selection for Test Case Generation

The system uses a sophisticated model selection algorithm to choose the optimal model for generating test cases:

1. **Domain Analysis**: The topic is analyzed to determine its domain (technical, creative, business, medical, or general)
2. **Model Rating**: Models are rated based on their performance in specific domains and their token efficiency
3. **Value Calculation**: A value score is calculated for each model (domain-specific quality Ã— token efficiency)
4. **Capacity Check**: The system checks available token capacity and selects models that fit within constraints
5. **Optimal Selection**: The highest-value model that fits within constraints is selected

### Test Case Structure

Each test case includes:

- **ID**: A unique identifier
- **Name**: A descriptive name
- **Category**: One of the standardized categories (e.g., factual-knowledge, problem-solving)
- **Prompt**: The actual test prompt
- **Expected Output**: Key points or criteria for evaluation

### Test Case Categories

The system supports the following test case categories:

- `factual-knowledge`: Testing recall of facts and information
- `problem-solving`: Testing ability to solve problems or puzzles
- `creative-writing`: Testing creative and narrative abilities
- `reasoning`: Testing logical reasoning and inference
- `technical-knowledge`: Testing specialized technical information
- `conceptual-understanding`: Testing grasp of abstract concepts
- `procedural-knowledge`: Testing understanding of processes and procedures
- `domain-specific-terminology`: Testing knowledge of specialized vocabulary
- `analytical-thinking`: Testing ability to analyze complex information
- `ethical-reasoning`: Testing understanding of ethical considerations

### Example

```javascript
// Generate 10 test cases on the topic of "machine learning"
const testCases = await generateTestCases("machine learning", 10);
```

## Intelligent Model Selection

### Overview

The model selection system intelligently chooses which LLMs to include in a benchmark based on the topic, available token capacity, and optional user preferences.

### Selection Process

1. **Available Models**: Retrieves available models from OpenRouter API
2. **Provider Filtering**: Optionally filters models by provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic)
3. **Topic Analysis**: Analyzes the topic to determine relevant model capabilities
4. **Model Ranking**: Ranks models based on their suitability for the topic
5. **Diversity Consideration**: Ensures a diverse selection of models for comprehensive benchmarking

### Model Ratings

Models are rated across different domains:

```javascript
const modelRatings = {
  "anthropic/claude-3-opus": {
    technical: 9.5, creative: 9.0, business: 9.5, medical: 9.5, general: 9.0,
    tokenEfficiency: 0.7, // Quality per token (lower efficiency due to higher cost)
    minTokens: 1500
  },
  "anthropic/claude-3-sonnet": {
    technical: 9.0, creative: 9.2, business: 9.0, medical: 9.0, general: 9.0,
    tokenEfficiency: 0.85, // Better efficiency than Opus
    minTokens: 1200
  },
  // Ratings for other models...
};
```

### Value Score Calculation

The value score combines domain-specific quality with token efficiency:

```javascript
valueScore = ratings[topicDomain] * ratings.tokenEfficiency;
```

### Example

```javascript
// Select up to 20 models for a benchmark on "quantum computing"
const selectedModels = await selectModels("quantum computing", 20);
```

## Benchmark Execution

### Overview

The benchmark execution system runs the selected models against the generated test cases and collects performance metrics.

### Metrics Collected

For each model and test case, the system collects:

- **Output**: The model's response to the prompt
- **Latency**: Time taken to generate the response
- **Token Count**: Number of tokens used (input and output)
- **Cost**: Estimated cost of the API call
- **Accuracy Score**: How well the response matches the expected output
- **Domain Expertise Score**: How well the model demonstrates domain knowledge

### Execution Process

1. **Initialization**: Sets up the benchmark with selected models and test cases
2. **Execution**: Runs each model against each test case
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluates responses against expected outputs
4. **Metrics Collection**: Collects and stores performance metrics
5. **Result Storage**: Saves results to the database

## Result Analysis

### Overview

The result analysis system evaluates benchmark results and provides insights into model performance.

### Analysis Types

The system supports three types of analysis:

1. **General Analysis**: Overall performance across all metrics
2. **Cost Efficiency Analysis**: Performance relative to cost
3. **Domain Expertise Analysis**: Performance across different knowledge domains

### Ranking Methodology

Models are ranked based on a weighted average of key metrics:

- **Accuracy**: 40% - How well responses match expected outputs
- **Domain Expertise**: 30% - Performance across different knowledge categories
- **Latency**: 10% - Response speed (lower is better)
- **Cost**: 20% - Cost efficiency (lower is better)

The overall score is calculated as:

```
score = (accuracy * 0.4) + (domainExpertise * 0.3) + (latencyScore * 0.1) + (costScore * 0.2)
```

Where:
- `latencyScore = max(0, 1 - (avgLatency / 10000))`
- `costScore = max(0, 1 - (totalCost / 0.1))`

## Domain Expertise Evaluation

### Overview

The domain expertise evaluation system assesses how well models perform across different knowledge domains and categories.

### Evaluation Process

1. **Category Assignment**: Test cases are assigned to categories
2. **Category Scoring**: Models are scored on each category
3. **Strength/Weakness Identification**: Top and bottom categories are identified for each model
4. **Consistency Calculation**: Consistency across categories is measured
5. **Domain Summary Generation**: A summary of domain expertise is generated

### Domain Insights

For each model, the system provides:

- **Overall Domain Expertise Score**: Average performance across all categories
- **Strengths**: Categories where the model excels
- **Weaknesses**: Categories where the model struggles
- **Consistency Score**: How consistent the model is across categories
- **Domain Summary**: A narrative summary of the model's domain expertise

### Example Domain Summary

```
GPT-4 demonstrates excellent domain expertise in quantum computing with an overall score of 92%. 
The model is highly consistent across different test categories. 
Key strengths: technical-knowledge (95%), reasoning (93%), conceptual-understanding (90%). 
Areas for improvement: creative-writing (85%), ethical-reasoning (82%).
```

## Cost Efficiency Analysis

### Overview

The cost efficiency analysis system evaluates the cost-effectiveness of different models.

### Analysis Process

1. **Cost Calculation**: Total cost and cost per test case are calculated
2. **Cost Efficiency Ranking**: Models are ranked by performance relative to cost
3. **Cost Breakdown**: Detailed cost breakdown is provided
4. **Cost Level Assignment**: Models are assigned a cost level (1-5)

### Cost Efficiency Metrics

- **Total Cost**: Total cost across all test cases
- **Cost Per Test Case**: Average cost per test case
- **Cost Efficiency Rank**: Ranking based on performance per dollar
- **Cost Level**: Simplified cost rating from 1 (expensive) to 5 (inexpensive)

## Usage Examples

## Extending the System

### Adding New Model Ratings

To add ratings for new models, update the `modelRatings` object in the `selectModelForTestCases` function:

```javascript
"new-model/model-name": {
  technical: 8.5, creative: 7.5, business: 8.0, medical: 7.0, general: 8.0,
  tokenEfficiency: 0.9,
  minTokens: 1000
}
```

### Adding New Test Case Categories

To add new test case categories, update the prompt template in the `generateTestCases` function and add corresponding category detection logic in the fallback case creation.

### Custom Analysis

You can create custom analysis functions by following the pattern of existing analyzers:

```javascript
const analyzeCustomMetric = async (benchmarkResult, rankings) => {
  // Your custom analysis logic here
  return {
    rankings: rankings.sort((a, b) => /* your custom sorting */),
    customMetricData: /* your custom data */
  };
};
```

## Conclusion
